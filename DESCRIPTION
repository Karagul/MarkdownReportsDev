Description: MarkdownReports is a set of R functions that allows you to generate precise figures easily,
    and create clean markdown reports about what you just discovered with your analysis script. It helps you to:
    1. Create scientifically accurate (annotated) figures with very short code, making use of variable-, row- and columnnames.
    2. Save figures automatically as vector graphic (.pdf), that you can use from presentation to posters anywhere.
    3. Incorporate your figures automatically in a markdown report file.
    4. Describe your figures & findings in the same report in a clear and nicely formatted way, parsed from your variables into english sentences.
    5. Share your report, by exporting your report to .pdf, .html or .docx, or via Github or a personal website.
